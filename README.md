# iSearch
This repository contains Python, Perl and Bash shell code for working with the iSearch test collection for IR research. 

Further information about iSearch can be found at [here] (http://itlab.dbit.dk/~isearch/).

The code pertains to manipulating iSearch documents (PDF and XML files dervied from ArXiv.org) in conjunction with newly acquired source files (TEX files from ArXiv.org); extracting citation contexts; and running retrieval with the [Indri] (http://www.lemurproject.org/indri/) search engine.
