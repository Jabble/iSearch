# iSearch
This repository contains Python, Perl, and Bash shell code for working with the iSearch test collection for information retrieval (IR) research. 

Further information about iSearch can be found at the [iSearch website] (http://itlab.dbit.dk/~isearch/).

The code pertains to manipulating iSearch documents (PDF and XML files dervied from ArXiv.org) in conjunction with newly acquired source files (TEX files from ArXiv.org); identifying and extracting citation contexts from within documents; and running retrieval experiments using the [Indri] (http://www.lemurproject.org/indri/) search engine.
